# Laravel OpenAPI

Welcome to the Laravel OpenAPI documentation! This package allows you to generate OpenAPI (formerly Swagger) specifications from your Laravel code using PHP 8 attributes.

## What is Laravel OpenAPI?

Laravel OpenAPI is a powerful package that enables you to document your API endpoints and data models directly in your code using PHP 8 attributes. This approach ensures your API documentation stays up-to-date with your implementation, making it easier to maintain and share your API specifications.

## Key features

- **Attribute-driven documentation**: Use PHP 8 attributes to document your API endpoints and models
- **Code-centric approach**: Keep your API documentation close to your code
- **No database introspection**: Model schemas are derived solely from explicitly annotated attributes
- **Laravel integration**: Seamlessly integrates with your Laravel projects
- **Swagger UI**: Built-in Swagger UI to visualize and interact with your API documentation
- **JSON and YAML support**: Generate specifications in both formats
- **PHP 8 enum support**: Document enum types in your API

## Quick example

Here's a quick example of how to document a controller method:

```php
<?php

namespace App\Http\Controllers;

use App\Models\User;
use Illuminate\Http\Request;
use LaravelOpenApi\Attributes as OA;

class UserController extends Controller
{
    #[OA\Operation(
        summary: 'List all users',
        description: 'Retrieves a paginated list of users.'
    )]
    #[OA\Response(
        response: 200,
        description: 'A list of users.',
        content: [
            new OA\MediaType(
                mediaType: 'application/json',
                schema: new OA\Schema(
                    type: 'array',
                    items: new OA\Items(ref: User::class)
                )
            )
        ]
    )]
    public function index()
    {
        // Your controller logic here
    }
}
```
