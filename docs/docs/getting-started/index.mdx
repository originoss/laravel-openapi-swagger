# Getting to know Laravel OpenAPI

Laravel OpenAPI is a powerful package for generating OpenAPI (formerly Swagger) specifications from your Laravel code using PHP 8 attributes. This approach allows you to keep your API documentation close to your code, ensuring it stays up-to-date with your API's implementation.

## Core concepts

- **Attribute-driven**: OpenAPI specifications are generated by parsing PHP 8 attributes (`#[Attribute]`) directly from your controllers and Eloquent models.
- **Code-centric**: Keep your API documentation within your codebase.
- **No database introspection**: The library does **not** connect to your database to infer schema information. Model schemas are derived solely from explicitly annotated `#[Property]` attributes on your model classes.
- **Explicit is better**: Only model properties that are explicitly annotated with `#[Property]` will be included in the generated OpenAPI specification.
- **Laravel Friendly**: Designed to integrate smoothly with Laravel projects, including Artisan commands for spec generation.
- **Model::class Support**: References to models can use the `Model::class` syntax for better IDE support and refactoring capabilities.
- **Enum Support**: Full support for PHP enums in your API documentation.

## Key features

- **Attribute-based documentation**: Use PHP 8 attributes to document your API endpoints and models.
- **Artisan commands**: Generate OpenAPI specifications with simple Artisan commands.
- **Swagger UI integration**: Built-in Swagger UI to visualize and interact with your API documentation.
- **JSON and YAML support**: Generate specifications in both JSON and YAML formats.
- **Customizable**: Flexible configuration options to tailor the documentation to your needs.
- **PHP 8 Enum Support**: Seamlessly document enum types in your API.

## When to use Laravel OpenAPI

Laravel OpenAPI is ideal for:

- Laravel API projects that need standardized, up-to-date documentation
- Teams that prefer keeping documentation close to the code
- Projects that need to generate OpenAPI specifications for client generation or API gateways
- Developers who want to leverage PHP 8 attributes for cleaner, more maintainable code

## Package Structure

The Laravel OpenAPI package is organized into several key components:

- **Attributes**: PHP 8 attributes for documenting API endpoints, parameters, responses, and models
- **Commands**: Artisan commands for generating OpenAPI specifications
- **Discovery**: Classes for discovering annotated controllers and models
- **Generators**: Classes for generating OpenAPI specifications
- **Http**: Controllers and routes for the Swagger UI
- **Parsers**: Classes for parsing attributes and generating OpenAPI objects
- **Schema**: Classes for representing OpenAPI schemas

## Example workflow

A typical workflow for using Laravel OpenAPI looks like this:

1. **Install the package** via Composer
2. **Configure the package** by publishing and editing the configuration file
3. **Document your API** by adding attributes to your controllers and models
4. **Generate the OpenAPI specification** using the provided Artisan command
5. **View your API documentation** using the built-in Swagger UI
